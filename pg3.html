				OCTOBER
   			 We started by assembling the drive system and the chassis system, along with assembling the practice course and really getting to know each other as a team.
   			 
			 	NOVEMBER
    			Now that the League Events have started, we are working on other parts such as new treads for our robot, a climbing arm, and strategies to use on the playing field. Being at the league events gave us great ideas, so we are putting them into action.
    			
  				DECEMBER
   			As League Events are ending and our best ten scores are being counted, we find out that our performance and points have put us into 1st place. Yes! What we have to do now is work out the kinks, like changing our treads because they have horrible traction when it comes to climbing up the mountain, and staying over the white line. 
				JANUARY
 			Coming into the New Year we are fixing minor problems like tightening loose screws, adjusting the treads, deciding on whether or not to take the risk of pushing debris and what not, and many others. The Inter League Championships are coming up, so we need to be in our prime condition to succeed. Good luck to all teams!
